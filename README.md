# Why this?

While reading the Rust book I found a lot of code that I've been writing and testing. Especially three projects. And I want to keep them as a...memory?

Here is [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
Here is the first project: [Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
Here is the second project: [Building a Command Line Program](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) aka `minigrep`
Here is the third project: [Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)
